# AES-encryptor-decryptor
A Python script to encrypt and decrypt data in AES-256. You can use it to talk to your friends in secrecy so no one can decode your messages or whatever.
Run "pip install pycryptodome" first

The format of how you need to copy and paste the encrypted and decrypted data is-

for encrypted data--

b'\x5F\x32\xCA\x1C\x5D\xB9\x0F\x36\x12\xB5\xB0\x8F\x65\x36\x9F\x8F'    //this is the correct format

\x5F\x32\xCA\x1C\x5D\xB9\x0F\x36\x12\xB5\xB0\x8F\x65\x36\x9F\x8F       //not this

0x5F, 0x32, 0xCA, 0x1C, 0x5D, 0xB9, 0x0F, 0x36, 0x12, 0xB5, 0xB0, 0x8F, 0x65, 0x36, 0x9F, 0x8F      //not this
